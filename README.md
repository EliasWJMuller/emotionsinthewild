This repository is a collection of code used in the reasearch paper "Recognizing Discrete Emotions in the Wild: A Comparative Performance Study of Facial Emotion Recognition APIs on AffectNet’s Set of Discrete and Static Emotions and its Implications for Practical Adaption" by Elias Müller, 2023.

Note: in order to reproduce the results, access to the different APIs and the AffectNet data set is necessary. Further, ensure that all package versions are equivalent to those in the code at hand.
